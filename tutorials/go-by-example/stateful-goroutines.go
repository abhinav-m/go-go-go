/*

In the previous example we used explicit locking with mutexes to synchronize
access to shared state across multiple goroutines. Another option is to use
the built-in synchronization features of goroutines and channels to achieve
the same result. This channel-based approach aligns with Goâ€™s ideas
of sharing memory by communicating and having each piece of data owned by exactly 1 goroutine.

In this example our state will be owned by a single goroutine.
This will guarantee that the data is never corrupted with concurrent access

	In order to read or write that state, other goroutines will send messages
	to the owning goroutine and receive corresponding replies. These readOp
	and writeOp structs encapsulate those requests and a way for the owning

Running our program shows that the goroutine-based state management example
completes about 98,000 total operations.

go run stateful-goroutines.go
readOps: 88930
writeOps: 8898
For this particular case the goroutine-based approach was a bit more involved than the mutex-based one.
It might be useful in certain cases though, for example where you have other channels involved or
when managing multiple such mutexes would be error-prone. You should use whichever approach
feels most natural, especially with respect to understanding the correctness of your program.
